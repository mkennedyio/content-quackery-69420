## About

I'm Michael Kennedy, a technology professional based in Toronto who helps organizations transform their infrastructure and applications through cloud modernization and artificial intelligence. My focus is on enabling enterprises to adopt cutting-edge technologies that drive real business value—whether that's migrating legacy applications to modern cloud-native architectures, implementing infrastructure-as-code practices, or integrating generative AI capabilities into existing workflows.

In today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, organizations face the challenge of balancing innovation with operational stability. I specialize in bridging this gap by leveraging proven cloud platforms (Google Cloud, AWS, VMware Cloud Foundation), modern infrastructure automation tools (Terraform, Vault, Consul), and emerging AI technologies to help companies modernize at their own pace while maintaining security and compliance standards.

My approach combines deep technical expertise with practical implementation experience. From architecting multi-cloud solutions to deploying secure infrastructure automation pipelines, I work with teams to not just adopt new technologies, but to fundamentally transform how they build, deploy, and operate applications in the cloud era. With the rise of generative AI, I'm particularly focused on helping organizations identify high-impact use cases and implement AI capabilities that enhance their competitive advantage.
